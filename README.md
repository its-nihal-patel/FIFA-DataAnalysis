# FIFA Player Data Analysis

This repository contains Python code for analyzing FIFA player data and creating visualizations based on the data. The code is written in Jupyter Notebook and uses various libraries such as pandas, numpy, matplotlib, and seaborn.

## Dataset

The code utilizes a dataset named "players_20.csv" which contains FIFA player data. The dataset includes information about players' nationality, club, wages, shooting skills, defending skills, and more.

## Code Overview

The code performs the following tasks:

1. Imports the required libraries for data analysis and visualization.
2. Reads the FIFA player data from the CSV file into a pandas DataFrame.
3. Displays basic information about the dataset such as the first few rows, shape, and column labels.
4. Analyzes and plots the top 10 countries with the most players using line, bar, histogram, and scatter plots.
5. Creates visualizations for the highest paid players and top-rated players for shooting and defending skills.
6. Provides specific analysis and plots for the Real Madrid club, including the highest paid players and top-rated players for shooting and defending skills within the club.

## Usage

To run the code and reproduce the visualizations, follow these steps:

1. Make sure you have Python installed on your machine.
2. Install the required libraries by running the following command: `pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn`.
3. Download the "players_20.csv" dataset and place it in the same directory as the Python code file.
4. Open the Python code file in a Jupyter Notebook or a similar environment.
5. Execute the code cells one by one to perform the analysis and create the visualizations.


I have explored the data with different graphs. Some of them as follows:
